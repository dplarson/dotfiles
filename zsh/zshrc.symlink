# Shortcut to this dotfiles path is $ZSH
export ZSH=$HOME/.dotfiles

# Source every .zsh file in this rep
for config_file in $ZSH/**/*.zsh; do source $config_file; done

# Private data stored outside .dotfiles in .localrc
if [[ -a ~/.localrc ]]
then
   source ~/.localrc
fi

# initialize autocomplete here, otherwise functions won't be loaded
autoload -U compinit
