## About
Vundle is a great Vim plugin manager by gmarik that I highly recommend.

## Requirements
Requires vundle by gmarik [https://github.com/gmarik/vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)

## Installation
1. Setup [Vundle]:

     ```
     $ git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle
     ```

2. Install configured bundles:

     Launch `vim`, run `:BundleInstall`. 

     Installing requires [Git] and triggers [Git clone](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) for each configured repo to `~/.vim/bundle/`.
